# 2014 Towards simultaneous interpreting_ the timing of incremental machine translation and speech synthesis.pdf

Here's a concise bullet point summary of the scientific article:

* **Main Idea:** Investigates methods to reduce latency in speech translation systems, aiming for a more natural "simultaneous interpretation" feel.
* **Methods:**
    * Developed an incremental speech translation system (combining speech recognition & translation).
    * Explored techniques for early output of translated speech (before full input is processed).
    * Used a corpus of simultaneous interpretation data (TED talks) for training & evaluation.
* **Key Results/Findings:**
    * Incremental processing *is* feasible for speech translation.
    * Early output introduces trade-offs between latency & translation quality.
    * System performance shows potential for near real-time translation, but requires ongoing refinement to balance speed and accuracy.
    * Stability of the message conveyed is a key factor for a good user experience.

# 2019 Integration of dubbing constraints into machine translation.pdf

Here's a concise bullet-point summary of the scientific article:

* **Main Idea:** Improving Neural Machine Translation (NMT) by addressing issues like length & fluency, specifically for dubbing/audiovisual translation where lip sync is crucial.
* **Methods:**
    * Developed a system to translate speech directly (speech-to-speech) using NMT.
    * Focused on ensuring translated speech matches the length/timing of the original for better lip-sync.
    * Used a scoring function based on syllable count & duration to re-rank NMT outputs.
* **Key Results/Findings:**
    * Direct speech-to-speech translation is feasible with NMT.
    * Length/timing control significantly improves the quality & naturalness of translated speech.
    * Syllable/duration scoring is effective for re-ranking NMT outputs to meet timing constraints.
    * System shows promise for applications like dubbing & AVT.
