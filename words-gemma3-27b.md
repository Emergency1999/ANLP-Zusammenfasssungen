# 2014 Towards simultaneous interpreting_ the timing of incremental machine translation and speech synthesis.pdf

Okay, here's a list of important words from the academic paper, with explanations. I've prioritized words that represent core concepts, methodologies, or significant findings.  I've aimed for around 20-25 words to keep it manageable.

**Important Words & Explanations:**

1.  **Incremental:**  Crucial to the paper. Refers to processing information (speech, translation) *as it arrives*, rather than waiting for a complete utterance. This is the core methodology they are exploring.
2.  **Simultaneous Interpretation:** The real-world task the paper aims to model.  The process of translating spoken language in real-time, as the speaker is still talking.
3.  **Speech Translation:** The broader field of automatically converting spoken language from one language to another.
4.  **Latency:** The delay between the input (speech) and the output (translation). A key metric for evaluating incremental systems; lower latency is better for real-time interaction.
5.  **Stability:** How consistent the translation is, even as more input arrives.  An unstable translation might change significantly with each new word, making it hard to follow.
6.  **Prosody:**  The rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech. The authors investigate how prosodic features can improve the quality of incremental speech synthesis.
7.  **Synthesis:** The process of generating speech from text (or in this case, translated text). The paper focuses on *incremental speech synthesis* – generating speech as the translation is created.
8.  **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text or speech into smaller units (tokens) for processing. Correct tokenization is essential for accurate translation.
9. **Corpus:** A large collection of text and/or speech data used for training and evaluating machine learning models.
10. **MARY TTS:** A specific text-to-speech synthesis system used in the experiments.
11. **TELIDA:** A toolkit used for manipulating and visualizing timed linguistic data, important for analyzing incremental processing.
12. **Evaluation:** The process of assessing the performance of the system, including metrics like latency and stability.
13. **Real-time:** Emphasizes the goal of creating systems that can operate with minimal delay, mimicking human interpreters.
14. **Accuracy:** How correct the translation is. While latency is crucial, the translation must also be accurate to be useful.
15. **Model:** A computational representation of a process (in this case, speech translation), used for making predictions or generating output.
16. **Features:** The specific characteristics of the input signal (speech) that are used by the model. (e.g. prosodic features)
17. **Decoding:** The process of converting the internal representation of the model into the final output (translated speech).
18. **Parallelism:** The idea of processing different parts of the input simultaneously to reduce latency.
19. **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task.
20. **Data-driven:** The approach of building systems based on analyzing large amounts of data.
21. **Just-in-time:** Generating output *exactly* when it's needed, as opposed to buffering or pre-calculating.
22. **Error Recovery:** The process of correcting errors or inconsistencies in the translation.
23. **User Study:** An experiment involving human participants to evaluate the performance of the system in a realistic setting.

These words represent the core concepts, methodologies, and goals of the research presented in the paper. They are essential for understanding the paper's contribution to the field of speech translation.

# 2019 Integration of dubbing constraints into machine translation.pdf

Okay, here's a list of important words from the academic paper, along with explanations of why they are key to understanding the research. I've aimed for a balance of technical terms, core concepts, and methodological elements.

**Important Words & Explanations:**

1.  **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** This is the *core technology* the paper revolves around. NMT uses neural networks to automatically translate text from one language to another. Understanding this is fundamental.

2.  **Dubbing/Audiovisual Translation:** This is the *application domain* the research focuses on.  It specifies that the translation isn’t just text, but specifically for synchronizing with video (dubbing) or creating subtitles.

3.  **Prosody:** Refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech. This is crucial because *how* something is said, not just *what* is said, is essential for dubbing to match the original performance.

4.  **Parallel Corpus:** This is the *data source*.  A parallel corpus is a collection of texts in two (or more) languages where each sentence or segment is aligned with its translation.  It's the training material for the NMT system.

5.  **Beam Search:** This is a *decoding algorithm* used in NMT. It's a search strategy used to find the most likely translation, but it often suffers from issues like generating repetitive or unnatural text. The paper likely investigates ways to improve it.

6.  **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** A *metric* used to automatically evaluate the quality of machine translation. It measures the overlap between the machine-translated text and one or more human reference translations.

7.  **Subword Units:** Techniques used to break down words into smaller units (like morphemes or character n-grams). This helps NMT handle rare words and improve translation quality.

8.  **Value Networks:** A reinforcement learning technique used to train NMT systems.  This helps NMT learn better policies for generating translations.

9. **Decoding:** The process of generating a translation from the trained NMT model. This is where the model takes the input and produces the translated output.

10. **Evaluation:** The process of assessing the quality of the generated translations using metrics like BLEU.

11. **Reinforcement Learning:** A learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. It's used here to optimize NMT decoding.

12. **Uncertainty:** Represents the confidence of the NMT model in its translation. Understanding and mitigating uncertainty is crucial for generating high-quality translations.
