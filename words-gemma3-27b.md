# 2009 Incremental reference resolution_ The task, metrics for evaluation, and a bayesian filtering model that is sensitive to disfluencies.pdf

Here's a list of keywords from the academic paper, with explanations:

* **Incremental Reference Resolution (IRR):** This is the core task the paper addresses. It's the process of figuring out *what* someone is talking about as they speak, building understanding piece-by-piece rather than waiting for a complete sentence. "Incremental" means happening step-by-step, and "reference resolution" is the act of identifying the entities being referred to.
* **Exophoric Reference:** This refers to references where the thing being talked about isn't directly present in the environment (e.g., referencing something from a previous conversation, or something generally known). It's a key challenge for IRR as the system has to rely on background knowledge.
* **Bayesian Model:**  The paper uses a probabilistic (Bayesian) approach to model uncertainty in identifying the referent. This means they calculate probabilities of different interpretations based on the evidence.
* **Disfluencies:** These are speech errors like "um" and "uh." The paper interestingly investigates if the model can *learn* from these, as they can signal difficulty in referencing something.
* **Probabilistic Robotics:** The authors draw inspiration from techniques used in robotics, where dealing with uncertainty is central. This approach allows them to handle the ambiguity inherent in language.
* **Dialogue System:** The ultimate goal is to integrate this IRR component into a working dialogue system, where it can aid in understanding user input and making appropriate responses.

# 2009 No sooner said than done_ testing incrementality of semantic interpretations of spontaneous speech.pdf

Here's a list of key words from the academic paper, with explanations:

* **Incrementality:** This is *the* central concept. It refers to processing information as it arrives, bit by bit, rather than waiting for complete input. The paper investigates how semantic interpretation can happen incrementally.
* **Semantic Chunking:** This describes the process of breaking down language into meaningful units (chunks) to build a semantic representation. The paper utilizes a "semantic chunker" to do this.
* **Spontaneous Speech:** The paper focuses on *naturally occurring* speech, as opposed to read text or carefully constructed sentences. Spontaneous speech is often disfluent, contains corrections, and is thus a good test for incremental processing.
* **Frame Semantics:**  This is the *type* of semantic representation used. Frame semantics organizes concepts around "frames" (e.g., "buying," "eating") which include concepts, relations and roles.
* **Evaluation Metrics (FCR, FFR, DC, FCE):** These are specific measures developed by the authors to *quantify* how well the semantic chunker performs *incrementally*. They assess things like how early semantic content is available (FCR/FFR), when the first correct meaning is established (FCE) and the overall degree of correctness over time (DC).
* **Robustness:** The paper emphasizes the *reliability* of their approach, particularly with the challenges posed by spontaneous speech. A robust system can handle imperfections and variations in input.

# 2013 Interactional adequacy as a factor in the perception of synthesized speech.pdf

Here's a list of key words from the academic paper, with explanations of their importance within the context of the research:

* **Incremental Speech Synthesis:** This is the *core* concept of the paper. It refers to generating speech piece-by-piece, as information becomes available, rather than creating a complete utterance before speaking. This allows for more reactive and adaptive speech.
* **Dialogue Systems:** The research is focused on improving speech synthesis *within* conversational systems, making them more natural and engaging.
* **Interactive Adequacy:** The paper argues that how well a system *responds* to the situation (interaction) is more important than just the *quality* of the synthesized speech itself.
* **HMM (Hidden Markov Models):** A statistical modeling technique used extensively in speech synthesis for representing and generating speech parameters. Understanding this is key to grasping the technical approach.
* **Real-time Processing:** The ability to synthesize speech *as* information is received is crucial for the incremental approach, and requires efficient processing.
* **Situational Awareness:** The system needs to understand the context of the conversation or environment to generate appropriate and relevant speech.
* **Adaptivity:** The system's ability to change its speech based on incoming information or user responses. A key goal of incremental synthesis.
