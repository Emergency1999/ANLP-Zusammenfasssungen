## Summary of "Incremental Speech Translation with Just-in-Time Synthesis"

This paper explores the challenges and potential of building a truly *incremental* speech translation system – one that delivers translated speech with minimal delay, mirroring the timing of the original speaker. The authors present a system combining automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and *just-in-time* text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. 

**Key Contributions & Findings:**

* **Focus on Incrementality:**  The paper emphasizes the need for systems that don't wait for complete sentences before translating, crucial for real-time applications like simultaneous interpretation.
* **Just-in-Time Synthesis:** They leverage a modified TTS system (MARYTTS) to synthesize translated speech as soon as possible, even with incomplete sentences, utilizing partial representations to improve prosody.
* **System Architecture:** The system utilizes ASR to transcribe speech, MT to translate the transcript, and then combines these with a decision tree-based approach to guide the TTS synthesis, optimizing for latency and naturalness.
* **Evaluation & Analysis:**  The authors present results using the IWSLT 2012 and 2013 datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of their approach. They highlight the trade-offs between latency, translation quality, and the impact of synthesis prosody.  Analysis reveals challenges in handling incomplete sentences and the importance of selecting appropriate prosodic features for a fluent translation.
* **Future Directions:** The paper outlines several avenues for future research, including improving the stability of the translation in early stages, exploring methods to automatically recover from mistranslations, and conducting user studies to assess the subjective quality of the system.



**In essence, the paper argues for a system that prioritizes *responsiveness* in speech translation, allowing for a more natural and engaging communication experience, even if it means sacrificing some degree of translation perfection.**  They demonstrate a working system and identify key areas for improvement in the pursuit of truly real-time incremental speech translation.

## Summary of "Determining Visible Speech for Dubbing: An Audio-Visual Approach"

This paper presents a novel approach to automatically determining whether a speaking face is visible on screen in a video – a crucial step towards improving the quality and naturalness of automatic dubbing. The researchers argue that dubbing should only apply synchrony constraints (visual-to-speech alignment) when the lips are actually visible.

**Key Contributions & Findings:**

* **Task Definition:** The paper formally defines the task of identifying for each spoken word whether the speaker’s face is visible.
* **Multi-Modal Approach:** They demonstrate that a multi-modal classifier (combining audio and video data) performs best on this task.
* **Dataset & Evaluation:**  The researchers likely created or utilized a dataset to train and evaluate their models, using metrics like per-word and per-utterance accuracy.
* **Dubbing Application:**  The ultimate goal is to integrate this technology into machine translation pipelines for dubbing, enabling more natural and visually consistent translations.
* **Challenges & Future Work:** The paper acknowledges challenges like imbalanced datasets, the difficulty of accurate face detection, and the need for further refinement of the approach.

**In essence, the paper proposes a machine learning solution to a critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of automatic dubbing – ensuring visual consistency between speech and the on-screen speaker.**  By accurately identifying visible speech, the technology aims to create more natural and engaging dubbed content.
