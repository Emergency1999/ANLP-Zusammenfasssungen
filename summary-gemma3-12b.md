# 2014 Towards simultaneous interpreting_ the timing of incremental machine translation and speech synthesis.pdf

Okay, here's a summary of the academic paper "Towards Real-Time Incremental Speech-to-Speech Translation":

**Overall Goal & Focus:**

The paper investigates methods for improving real-time speech-to-speech translation systems, specifically focusing on *incremental* processing. Incremental processing means the system starts producing output (translation) *before* the entire input sentence is received, allowing for faster perceived latency.

**Key Findings & Approaches:**

*   **Challenges of Incremental Systems:** The authors highlight that incremental systems face challenges in balancing speed (low latency) with accuracy (producing a correct and fluent translation). They need to deal with uncertainty in the ongoing speech.
*   **Focus on Simultaneous Interpretation Data:** They leverage data from simultaneous interpreters (human translators) as a valuable resource.  Simultaneous interpreters make decisions and produce translations in real-time, providing a model for how an incremental system should behave.
*   **MARY TTS & Corpus Analysis:** The study employs the MARY text-to-speech system and performs corpus analysis of simultaneous interpretation data to guide the development of their system.
*   **Incremental processing with SPECTRA:** They develop and experiment with the SPECTRA system, a cloud-based speech-to-speech translation system, using a combination of techniques from speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis.
*   **MARY TTS improvements** The authors developed new techniques for improved prosody using MARY TTS, improving the listening experience.

**Significance:**

The paper contributes to the field of machine translation by demonstrating the potential of leveraging human simultaneous interpretation data to create more responsive and natural-sounding speech-to-speech translation systems.  It also presents useful improvements for incremental processing, and emphasizes the role of corpus analysis and techniques for improving listening experience.

**Paper Title:** Determining Spoken Face Visibility for Automatic Dubbing

**Core Problem & Motivation:**

The paper tackles the problem of automatically determining when a speaker's face is visible during a video. This is crucial for improving automatic dubbing (the process of replacing original audio with translated audio) by enabling fine-grained control – allowing synchrony constraints (matching lip movements to translated audio) to be applied *only* when the face is visible.

**Key Contributions & Approach:**

*   **New Task Definition:** The paper formally defines a new task: classifying each word spoken in a video as either "face visible" or "face not visible."
*   **Multi-Modal Classifier:** They developed a machine learning model (a classifier) that combines both audio and video information to make this determination.
*   **Dataset and Experiments:** The researchers created and annotated a dataset specifically for this task. They conducted experiments to evaluate the classifier's performance.
*   **Analysis:** They performed an analysis of the classifier’s errors, noting challenges related to face detection accuracy and imbalanced data (more "face visible" examples than "face not visible").

**Key Findings:**

*   The multi-modal approach (using both audio and video) was effective in determining face visibility.
*   Improving the accuracy of face detection is crucial for better performance.
*   Data imbalance (unequal representation of "face visible" and "face not visible" words) poses a challenge.
*   The developed method can significantly improve the quality of automatic dubbing by allowing for more precise synchronization.

**Overall Significance:**

The paper introduces a novel task and provides a practical solution for improving automatic dubbing, contributing to the development of more realistic and high-quality machine translation systems for video content.
